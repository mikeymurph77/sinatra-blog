# Sinatra Blog

---
### This is just a fun tutorial I found from [Michael Herman's blog](http://mherman.org/)
**Article:** [Designing With Class: Sinatra + Postgresql + Heroku](http://mherman.org/blog/2013/06/08/designing-with-class-sinatra-plus-postgresql-plus-heroku/).


## Purpose
Lately I've been thinking of some fun silly apps to create, but felt using Rails might be too clunky for the purpose of these tiny apps.

I haven't created a Sinatra app in almost 2 years and thought this tutorial could be used as a great refresh.

## Couple Remarks
* I was unaware Sinatra had so many useful little extensions. Some of the ones I used were:

        sinatra-flash
        sinatra-redirect-with-flash
        sinatra-captcha

* I will definitely be looking more into Sinatra's documentation to see when Sinatra might be a better framework over Rails.

* Also the routing in Sinatra strengthens my appreciation towards Rails routing. I forgot that Sinatra combines the controller actions and routes together.

## Plans
In it's current state this Sinatra Blog is essentially an identical clone from the tutorial. Though there is no plans to expand on this repo, I'll leave the option open and comment on any updates in this README.
